Stop harassing me. I am a good engineer and I have worked really hard to be where I am. Your insecurity tried to destroy a lot of that. But you can't destroy me, the same way you can't destroy all the other FOUR good engineers that you created lies so that they would leave. Good engineers that are doing very well now, in contrary of your theory.

You are a smart dude and you will be ok if you stop trying to do bad to people. **Stop stalking people**. Go outside. You are what is bad in the world but you can change. Your ego is destroying your life and the others around you.

I really hope the Universe will help me to never see your face again, and I am recoverying from the damage you did to me. I can only wish the universe will protect me from people like you in the future.

And here, my friends, another case of a white male that did all he could to demoralize a latina foreigner woman in our world. And he cannot stop. Trump++. 

Guess what, you are not the first and you won't be the last.

In other times of my life I would feel self-conscious and think I am just not good enough and I don't belong here. Thankfully today I know I am awesome and I will not let sexism, prejudice, xenophobia take my credit and my worth. 

You can keep trying but I am not going to stop. I am going to conquer the world.

Bye bye.
