Leave me alone. I am a good and serious engineer and your insecurity tried to destroy a lot of that. But you can't destroy me, the same way you can't destroy all the other FOUR good engineers that you created lies so that they would leave. Good engineers that are doing very well now, in contrary of your theory.

You are a smart dude and you will be ok if you stop trying to do bad to people. **Stop stalking people**. Go outside. You are what is bad in the world but you can change. Your ego is destroying your life and the others around you.

I really hope the Universe will help me to never see your face again, and I am recoverying from the damage you did to me. I can only wish the universe will protect me from people like you in the future.
